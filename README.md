# Writing by Numbers
This repository contains the datasets from my PhD thesis 'Writing by Numbers: Case Studies in Digital Art History'

There are two datasets:

'ParisSalonDataset.xlxs' which contains a random sample of 9,000 catalogue entries taken from the catalogues of the Paris fine art Salon covering the decades from the 1790s to the 1870s, together with a boost sample for women artists.

'ModernandContemporaryArtMetadata.xlxs', which contains metadata downloaded and processed from a number of online modern and contemporary art museum collections.  

Both datsets were compiled for the purpose of the identification of long-term patterns or trends, and their construction involved a significant amount of processing of the catalogue entries and collection metadata. For example, the main parts of each catalogue entry were transcribed without accents, and the non-English titles given in the metadata were all translated into English using Google translate.  For details on how they were constructed and caveats over their use see the notes in each spreadsheet and the discussions in my thesis. For instance, the Paris Salon dataset is not suitable for use to identify short-term trends, and the modern and contemporary art metadata should not be used for detailed readings of the titles used by indvidual artists.
