# Writing by Numbers
This repository contains the datasets from my PhD thesis 'Writing by Numbers: Case Studies in Digital Art History'

There are two datasets:

'ParisSalonDataset.xlxs' which contains a random sample of 9,000 catalogue entries taken from the catalogues of the Paris fine art Salon covering the decades from the 1790s to the 1870s, together with a boost sample for women artists. The main text of each entry was transcribed by hand and does not include accents. This dataset is currently being prepared and will be uploaded in due course.


'ModernandContemporaryArtMetadata.xlxs', which contains the metadata downloaded and processed from a number of online modern and contemporary art museum collections.  This dataset is currently being prepared and will be uploaded in due course.
